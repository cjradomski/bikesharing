# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
## Should There Be Bike-Sharing in Des Moines, Iowa?
### In this analysis, New York data from Citi-Bike, a bike-sharing service, will be looked at to determine the types of customers and how the service is utilized. Then a population comparison will be made between New York and Des Moines to create a rough estimate of how the bike-sharing service will perform in Des Moines. The questions this analysis attempts to answer in regards to setting up a bike sharing service are: 
### * What is the population of Des Moines? 
### * How does its population compare to the population of New York City? 
### * Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

In the month of August 2019, there were 2,344,224 records of ride-sharing that were mostly conentrated in the Manhattan area. 

Most records show that bikes were rented between 1 to 6 days. 

In regards to the customers, most of them were male and subsribers to the service. In addition, those who rented the bike for longer of periods of time tended to be younger.

When looking a the population of Des Moines compared to New York, Des Moines has 13.2% of the population of New York based on the U.S Census Bureau. Thus, a rough estimate based solely on New York's population would indicate that Des Moines would see 309,438 records of ride sharing in a month. 

#### Steps Moving Forward:

If Des Moines were to have Citi Bike provide it's services to the city, further analysis would need to be conducted to provide the appropriate amount of biciycles as well as get information on what specific customers should be targeted in Des moines.

The public transporation system should also be analyzed to determine if bike-sharing would be popular compared to the public transit available in Des Moines. DART, the Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority, is the primary transporation service provider in Iowa and provides various bus routes and ride share services based on its website. 

In addition, locations of where the bikes should be located need to be determined. Based on Catch Des Moines, a tourist website, Des Moines has popular bike trails that could be perfect locations for Citi Bike to set-up its services.

New York can still be studied to determine the types of customers that are using Citi Bike's services and have it reflect in Des Moines. For example, it was indicated in the New York data that mostly males had used the services. Des Moines and New York have similar gender ratios (both 1:1) based on the U.S Census Bureau. Furthermore, based on the analysis, most of the customers for the service were subscribers. This possibly indicate that tourists don't use the service as much as residents that use the service often, demonstrating that city's population will play a key feature in determining the service's performance.
